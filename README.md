# Decentralized-Study-Timer-Contrac# Decentralized Study Timer

## Project Description

The Decentralized Study Timer is a revolutionary blockchain-based educational platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This innovative system empowers students and learners to track their study sessions, monitor progress, and maintain accountability in a completely decentralized and transparent manner.

The platform enables users to start and end study sessions with subject tracking, automatic time calculation, and comprehensive progress analytics. All study data is stored immutably on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity, privacy, and complete ownership of educational progress records. Students can track their study streaks, total study time, and session history while contributing to a global community of learners.

Key features include subject-based session tracking, automatic duration calculation, streak monitoring, and detailed analytics that help students understand their learning patterns and maintain consistent study habits.
